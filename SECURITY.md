## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please do **not** create a GitHub issue, but report a [security vuln on GitHub instead!](https://github.com/Kristify/Kristify/security/advisories).
This lets the maintainers get aware of the vulnerability and talk with the security researched in private. If you believe you found a security vulnerability, please do not talk about it in public!
